# ZMK Personal Firmware for Sofle Keyboard

This repository contains my personal firmware for the Sofle keyboard, built using [ZMK firmware](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/).
The [Sofle keyboard](https://github.com/josefadamcik/SofleKeyboard) is a split ergonomic keyboard that allows for a customizable and comfortable typing experience.
This firmware is tailored to my specific preferences and key mappings.
